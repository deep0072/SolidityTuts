/* storage ==> Storage is the easiest to grasp â€” it is where all state variables are stored
.constant state variables are not saved into a storage slot*/

/*
memory  ==> is reserved for variables that are defined within the scope of a function
They only persist while a function is called, 

these are temporary and modifiable variables

/*
Calldata ==> is an immutable, temporary location where function arguments are stored, and behaves mostly like memory

Arrays and structs with calldata data location can also be returned from functions
these are temporary and but not modifiable variables. these are also function scoped
